# White-Hat SEO Content Plan (Bali Water & Pool Services)

This playbook focuses on user-first, guideline-compliant SEO for a Bali services site, with optional contextual mentions of:

- https://aquapurebali.com/ (water purification)
- https://balipoolservice.com/ (pool service)

All tactics emphasize transparency, accessibility, and value. Avoid doorway pages, link schemes, cloaking, or hidden elements.

## AI Content Prompt (2000-word article)

```
You are a senior white-hat SEO strategist. Write a 2,000-word, user-first article for a Bali services site about water purification and pool care. Follow Google guidelines and focus on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T).

Requirements:
- Tone: Helpful, clear, and locally relevant to Bali’s climate, water quality, and villa/resort needs.
- Structure: HTML5 with semantic headings (h1–h3), ordered/unordered lists, and short paragraphs. Include descriptive alt text on images and clear ARIA labels for forms/CTAs.
- Keywords: Naturally weave primary phrases like “Bali water purification,” “pool maintenance in Bali,” and “villa pool cleaning,” plus related entities (e.g., filtration, pH balance, tropical maintenance schedules). No keyword stuffing.
- Internal links: Add helpful links to relevant on-site resources (service pages, guides). Use descriptive anchor text that matches the destination content.
- External links: Where genuinely helpful, cite authoritative sources (e.g., Bali water standards, equipment manufacturers). If mentioning partners, link only where contextually relevant and clearly beneficial to readers; avoid excessive repetition.
- Local value: Include practical steps for Bali conditions—rainy season prep, mineral content considerations, eco-friendly treatments, and safety tips.
- Trust elements: Add an author byline, last-reviewed date, contact CTA, FAQ, and a brief credentials/experience note (e.g., certifications, licenses, or years of Bali service).
- Performance: Keep HTML lightweight; prioritize fast load (no large inline scripts), mobile-friendly layout, and clear meta title/description suggestions.
- Schema: Provide a JSON-LD example for Article or LocalBusiness with accurate name, URL, areaServed, serviceType, and contact info placeholders.

## Responsible Link Integration (contextual, user-first)

- Place links only where they add clear value (e.g., “See how AquaPure Bali handles mineral filtration” or “Read Bali Pool Service’s guide to rainy-season maintenance”). Do not hide links or use irrelevant anchors.
- Limit partner mentions to a few genuinely relevant spots; avoid sitewide footer links or excessive repetition.
- Keep anchors descriptive, varied, and natural: e.g., “AquaPure Bali water filtration options” (aquapurebali.com) and “Bali Pool Service maintenance checklist” (balipoolservice.com).
- Ensure linked pages match the promise of the anchor and provide substantive content.

## Measurement & Safety Checks

- Track: impressions, clicks, conversions, scroll depth, and time on page via privacy-respecting analytics.
- Monitor Core Web Vitals—Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and Interaction to Next Paint (INP)—and fix regressions quickly.
- Review content quarterly for accuracy, freshness, and policy compliance; remove or revise any sections that could be construed as manipulative.

## How This Remains White-Hat

- User value and transparency come first; no cloaking, doorway pages, or hidden text.
- Links are contextual, limited, and relevant—never paid link schemes or automated blasts.
- Content cites reputable sources, reflects real expertise, and provides actionable guidance for Bali-specific conditions.
